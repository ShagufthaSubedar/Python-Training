'''Special String
Alice has a string A consisting of lowercase English letters. Her friend gives her another string S
and asks her to modify string A and replace its characters with the characters present in string S.
But, to achieve the above task, Alice must follow the below steps:
1. Choose a character from string S that has the minimum ASCII distance from the ith character in
string A
Replace the ith character in string A with the chosen character in string S
Your task is to find and return an integer value, representing minimum total ASCII distance that is
required to modify string A to the characters in string S. Return 0, if all the characters in string S
are already present in string A
Sample Input:
abcd
xyz
SampleÂ Output:
86'''
